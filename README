To install this application into Mule Studio please complete the following steps:

- Clone/Import - After cloning from git, import to Mule Studio "File > Import > Mule > Mule Studio Project from External Location"

To test simply start the application in Mule Studio "Run As > Mule Application", then invoke the following service from a web browser:

- http://localhost:8444?airportCode=LAX

- This will return a simple string (map) of values that represent the price each airline offers for flying to the nominated airport code.

- The mock airlines being represented are United, Delta & Alaskan.

- Note: Other valid airport codes are LAX, KOA, OAK, SFO

- Note also: With the current version of Mule Studio 3.2.1 you will see some errors associated with the CXF components, which can be treated as warnings & ignored.
